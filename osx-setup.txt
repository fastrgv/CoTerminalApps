Setup on OS-X


If you have a previous installation of the game on your computer, 
then delete it by typing something like:

	rm -fr <game-installation-directory>/<game-dir>

This will save space on your computer's disk drive, and will 
help to avoid confusion.  Each download is self-contained.

Choose an installation directory and move the tarball there;  
leaving it in ./Downloads is fine.

For *.7z files, you may use Keka or 7zip to unpack the tarred 
game directory.

For *.gz files, simply gunzip [] followed by tar -xf [].
