Where is the Ada source code?

This repository exists for the convenience of gamers, not co-developers.  The tarball contains all the source code, as well as the runtime files for 3 platforms, headers, shaders, textures, music, game files, compilation scripts, nonstandard external libraries, and executables, including a Mac-bundle.  Source code can be found in the root directory and the ./adabindings & ./adautils sub-directories.
