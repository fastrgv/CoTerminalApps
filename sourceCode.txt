Where is the Ada source code?

This repository exists for the convenience of gamers, not co-developers.  
The tarball contains all the source code, as well as the runtime files 
for 3 platforms, headers, shaders, textures, music, game files, 
compilation scripts, nonstandard external libraries, and executables, 
including a Mac-bundle.  Source code can be found in the root directory 
and the ./adabindings & ./adautils sub-directories.

=====================================================================
Note for Windows users:
I suggest using 7z [from www.7-zip.org] to unzip, 
and then untar the files <name.tar.gz>:

1) 7z name.tar.gz [this unzips a tar file]

2) 7z name.tar [this untars a tar file into a directory]

After step 2 you should have a new directory:

.\name\

that contains the source code, etc.

===================================================
On osx or linux you do the usual:

1) gunzip name.tar.gz
2) tar -xf name.tar
