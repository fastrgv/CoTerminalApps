Where is the Ada source code?

This repository exists for the convenience of gamers, not co-developers.  
The tarball, *.gz or *.7z, contains all the source code, 
as well as the runtime files for 3 platforms, headers, shaders, textures, 
music, game files, compilation scripts, nonstandard external libraries, 
and executables, including a Mac-bundle.  Source code can be found in
the main directory and the ./adabindings & ./adautils sub-directories.
