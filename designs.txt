My Design Goals (for Potential Contributors):

I dislike both Microsoft and Apple because of the freedoms and privacy 
they deny me; I fully support the F.S.F. [Free Software Foundation].
Thusly, I choose to minimize my involvment with their esoteric OS's.  
Still, I want my Apps to reach their large audiences, if possible.

My design goals are to 
A) require NOTHING of mere users, and 
B) for rebuilders/developers, require only that they install 
	minimal Ada on their machines.

Specifically, I prefer to NOT require Windows users to install MINGW.  
Thusly, and for other reasons, I choose to avoid Makefiles.  
Even gpr build files require more than a minimal Ada installation.
So I choose to use script/bat files.

Furthermore, I prefer to NOT require users to install nonstandard 
libraries or 3rd party utilities in order to execute my apps.
