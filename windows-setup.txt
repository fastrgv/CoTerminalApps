File extraction on Windows:

If you have a previous installation of the game on your computer, 
then delete it by typing something like:

	RMDIR/S <game-directory>

from a command line terminal.

This will save space on your computer's disk drive, and will 
help to avoid confusion.


Next, move the newest archive, a 7z file 
[from your Downloads directory] to any directory of your choosing;
Then "cd" to that directory.

Next, unzip:

A) If you have it, PeaZip seems to work fine for all archive types.

B) If you do not already have an unzip utility, I recommend 
downloading 7z [from www.7-zip.org].  It's free, and works nicely:
1) 7z x <file-name>.7z [this unzips contents to a new game-dir]
2) cd <game-dir>

Note that WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux] is not supported.
Simply use the Windows executable provided.

Note also that any error messages you might see about failure to 
create links can be IGNORED.  These linked files are used only 
on linux or Mac OSX systems.
