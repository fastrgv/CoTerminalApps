Tar file extraction on Windows:

If you have a previous installation of the game on your computer, 
then delete it by typing something like:

	RMDIR/S <game-installation-directory>\<game-dir>

from a command line terminal.

This will save space on your computer's disk drive, and will 
help to avoid confusion.


Next, move the newest archive, a zip-file or gz-file [from your Downloads directory] to any directory of your choosing:
move <file-name>.tar.gz <game-installation-directory>
cd <game-installation-directory>

Next, extract the tarball:

A) If you have it, PeaZip seems to work fine.

B) If you do not already have an unzip utility, I recommend 
downloading 7z [from www.7-zip.org].  It's free, and works nicely:
1) 7z x <file-name>.tar.gz [this unzips a tar file]
2) 7z x <file-name>.tar    [this creates a new directory]
3) cd <game-dir>

C) Alternatively, if you have a recent version of Windows 10, simply type:
1) tar -xf <file-name>.tar.gz
to extract everything into the current directory.  Then:
2) cd <game-dir>

Attention:
there may be error messages [about failure to create links] that can be IGNORED.  These linked files are used only on linux or Mac OSX systems.
